80% of zybook participation activities => 100% credit  
2 discussion section drops  

## overview
discrete structures - can be enumerated!  
## logic & proofs
`induction`
1. shows some property holds for all items in a discrete structure
2. used to show program correctness

`recursion`:   
`program analysis`: big O, big theta, etc. (time complexity!)
