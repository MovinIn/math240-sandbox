## overview
discrete structures - can be enumerated!  
## logic & proofs
`induction`
1. shows some property holds for all items in a discrete structure
2. used to show program correctness

`recursion`:   
`program analysis`: big O, big theta, etc. (time complexity!)
### Propositions
A `proposition` is a statement that can be either true or false, but not both.   
$$P \implies Q$$ is `false` if $$P$$ is true, but $$Q$$ is false. Otherwise, $$P \implies Q$$ is `true`.   
$$P \iff Q$$ means $$P$$ is `T/F` if and only if $$Q$$ is `T/F` respectively. This statement is also logically equivalent to $$(P \implies Q) \land (Q \implies P)$$  
$$P \land Q$$ is true if and only if $$P$$ is true AND $$Q$$ is true.   
$$P \lor Q$$ is true if $$P$$ OR $$Q$$ is true.
